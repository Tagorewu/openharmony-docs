# @Prop


@Prop and @State have the same semantics but different initialization modes. Variables decorated by @Prop must be initialized using the @State decorated variable provided by their parent components. The @Prop decorated variable can be modified in the component, but the modification is not updated to the parent component; that is, @Prop uses one-way data binding.


The @Prop state data has the following features:


- Support for simple types: The number, string, and boolean types are supported.

- Private: Data is accessed only within the component.

- Support for multiple instances: A component can have multiple attributes decorated by @Prop.

- Support for initialization with a value passed to the @Prop decorated variable: When a new instance of the component is created, all @Prop decorated variables must be initialized. Initialization inside the component is not supported.


## Example

```ts
// xxx.ets
@Entry
@Component
struct ParentComponent {
    @State countDownStartValue: number = 10 // 10 Nuggets default start value in a Game
    build() {
        Column() {
            Text(`Grant ${this.countDownStartValue} nuggets to play.`)
            Button() {
                Text('+1 - Nuggets in New Game')
            }.onClick(() => {
                this.countDownStartValue += 1
            })
            Button() {
                Text('-1  - Nuggets in New Game')
            }.onClick(() => {
                this.countDownStartValue -= 1
            })
            // When creating a child component, you must provide the initial value of its @Prop decorated variable in the constructor parameter and initialize the regular variable CostOfOneAttump (not Prop).
            CountDownComponent({ count: this.countDownStartValue, costOfOneAttempt: 2})
        }
    }
}

@Component
struct CountDownComponent {
    @Prop count: number
    private costOfOneAttempt: number

    build() {
        Column() {
            if (this.count > 0) {
                Text(`You have ${this.count} Nuggets left`)
            } else {
                Text('Game over!')
            }

            Button() {
                Text('Try again')
            }.onClick(() => {
                this.count -= this.costOfOneAttempt
            })
        }
    }
}
```

In the preceding example, when you press +1 or -1, the status of the parent component changes and the build method is executed again. In this case, a new CountDownComponent is created. The countDownStartValue property of the parent component is used to initialize the @Prop decorated variable of the child component. When you tap the Try again button of the child component, the value of the @Prop decorated variable count is changed. As a result, the CountDownComponent is rendered again. However, the change of the count value does not affect the countDownStartValue value of the parent component.

> **NOTE**
>
> When a new component instance is created, all its @Prop decorated variables must be initialized.
