# LittleFS


## Basic Concepts

LittleFS is a small file system designed for flash. By combining the log-structured file system and the copy-on-write (COW) file system, LittleFS stores metadata in log structure and data in the COW structure. This special storage empowers LittleFS high power-loss resilience. LittleFS uses the statistical wear leveling algorithm when allocating COW data blocks, effectively prolonging the service life of flash devices. LittleFS is designed for small-sized devices with limited resources, such as ROM and RAM. All RAM resources are allocated through a buffer with the fixed size (configurable). That is, the RAM usage does not grow with the file system.

LittleFS is a good choice when you look for a flash file system that is power-cut resilient and has wear leveling support on a small device with limited resources.

## Development Guidelines

When porting LittleFS to a new hardware device, you need to declare **lfs_config**:

  
```
const struct lfs_config cfg = {
    // block device operations
    .read  = user_provided_block_device_read,
    .prog  = user_provided_block_device_prog,
    .erase = user_provided_block_device_erase,
    .sync  = user_provided_block_device_sync,

    // block device configuration
    .read_size = 16,
    .prog_size = 16,
    .block_size = 4096,
    .block_count = 128,
    .cache_size = 16,
    .lookahead_size = 16,
    .block_cycles = 500,
};
```

**.read**, **.prog**, **.erase**, and **.sync** correspond to the read, write, erase, and synchronization APIs at the bottom layer of the hardware platform, respectively.

**read_size** indicates the number of bytes read each time. You can set it to a value greater than the physical read unit to improve performance. This value determines the size of the read cache. However, if the value is too large, more memory is consumed.

**prog_size** indicates the number of bytes written each time. You can set it to a value greater than the physical write unit to improve performance. This value determines the size of the write cache and must be an integral multiple of **read_size**. However, if the value is too large, more memory is consumed.

**block_size**: indicates the number of bytes in each erase block. The value can be greater than that of the physical erase unit. However, a smaller value is recommended because each file occupies at least one block. The value must be an integral multiple of **prog_size**.

**block_count** indicates the number of blocks that can be erased, which depends on the capacity of the block device and the size of the block to be erased (**block_size**).


## Sample Code

  The sample code is as follows:
  
```
#include "lfs.h"
#include "stdio.h"
lfs_t lfs;
lfs_file_t file;
const struct lfs_config cfg = {
    // block device operations
    .read  = user_provided_block_device_read,
    .prog  = user_provided_block_device_prog,
    .erase = user_provided_block_device_erase,
    .sync  = user_provided_block_device_sync,
    // block device configuration
    .read_size = 16,
    .prog_size = 16,
    .block_size = 4096,
    .block_count = 128,
    .cache_size = 16,
    .lookahead_size = 16,
    .block_cycles = 500,
};
int main(void) {
    // mount the filesystem
    int err = lfs_mount(&lfs, &cfg);
    // reformat if we can't mount the filesystem
    // this should only happen on the first boot
    if (err) {
        lfs_format(&lfs, &cfg);
        lfs_mount(&lfs, &cfg);
    }
    // read current count
    uint32_t boot_count = 0;
    lfs_file_open(&lfs, &file, "boot_count", LFS_O_RDWR | LFS_O_CREAT);
    lfs_file_read(&lfs, &file, &boot_count, sizeof(boot_count));
    // update boot count
    boot_count += 1;
    lfs_file_rewind(&lfs, &file);
    lfs_file_write(&lfs, &file, &boot_count, sizeof(boot_count));
    // remember the storage is not updated until the file is closed successfully
    lfs_file_close(&lfs, &file);
    // release any resources we were using
    lfs_unmount(&lfs);
    // print the boot count
    printf("boot_count: %d\n", boot_count);
}
```


 **Verification**

The development is successful if the return result is as follows:

  
```
Say hello 1 times.
```
