# Agent-Powered Scheduled Reminder Overview

Your application can call the  **ReminderRequest**  class to create scheduled reminders for countdown timers, calendar events, and alarm clocks. When the created reminders are published, the timing and pop-up notification functions of your application will be taken over by the reminder agent in the background, even when your application is frozen or exits.
