# OpenHarmony Third-Party Components

OpenHarmony third-party components are verified software that work with the OpenHarmony system to facilitate your development of OpenHarmony devices or applications. Depending on the programming language they use, these components are classified as JS/TS third-party components or C/C++ third-party components. JS/TS third-party components use JavaScript or TypeScript and are usually imported as source code or OpenHarmony npm packages. They are used in application development. C/C++ third-party components use the programming language C/C++ and are usually imported as source code or OpenHarmony hpm packages. They are used as native APIs during application development or directly compiled in the OpenHarmony OS image during device development.

Currently, OpenHarmony provides UI, animation, image, multimedia, file, network, security, tool, and other third-party components.
