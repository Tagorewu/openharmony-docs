# Setting Up the Windows+Ubuntu Hybrid Development Environment


In embedded development, Windows-based tools, such as Visual Studio Code, are widely used in code editing. Yet, as the source code of most development boards, such as Hi3861 and Hi3516, cannot be built in Windows, these development boards require the Ubuntu development environment.


In the Windows+Ubuntu hybrid development environment, you can enjoy the benefits of both DevEco Device Tool for Windows and DevEco Device Tool for Ubuntu (where Visual Studio Code is optional).


## System Requirements

- Windows: Windows 10 (64-bit)

- Ubuntu: Ubuntu 20.04 or later; recommended memory: 16 GB or higher

- User name (Ubuntu): cannot contain Chinese characters

- DevEco Device Tool: 3.0 Release


## Setting Up the Ubuntu Development Environment

> ![icon-note.gif](public_sys-resources/icon-note.gif) **NOTE**
> If the Ubuntu system has not been set up yet, set it up on a virtual machine running Windows. Then, configure the Ubuntu basic environment.

1. Make sure the Ubuntu shell environment is **bash**.
   1. Run the following command and check whether the command output is **bash**. If the command output is not **bash**, go to step 2.
      
       ```
       ls -l /bin/sh
       ```

   2. Start the command-line tool, run the following command, enter your password, and select **No** to set **Ubuntu shell** to **bash**.
      
       ```
       sudo dpkg-reconfigure dash
       ```

       ![en-us_image_0000001243641075](figures/en-us_image_0000001243641075.png)

2. Download the [DevEco Device Tool 3.0 Release Linux version](https://device.harmonyos.com/cn/ide#download).

3. Decompress the DevEco Device Tool software package and assign permission on the folder obtained from the decompression.

   1. Go to the directory where the DevEco Device Tool software package is stored and run the following command to decompress the software package. In the command, change **devicetool-linux-tool-3.0.0.401.zip** to the actual software package name.
      
       ```
       unzip devicetool-linux-tool-3.0.0.401.zip
       ```

   2. Open the folder of the decompressed software package and run the following command to grant the execute permission on the installation file. In the command, change **devicetool-linux-tool-3.0.0.401.sh** to the actual installation file name.
      
       ```
       chmod u+x devicetool-linux-tool-3.0.0.401.sh
       ```

4. Run the following command to install DevEco Device Tool, where **devicetool-linux-tool-3.0.0.401.sh** indicates the installation file name.

   ```
   sudo ./devicetool-linux-tool-3.0.0.401.sh
   ```

## Configuring Windows to Remotely Access the Ubuntu Development Environment


### Installing the SSH Service and Obtaining the IP Address for Remote Access

1. In Ubuntu, open the Terminal tool and run the following command to install the SSH service:

   > ![icon-note.gif](public_sys-resources/icon-note.gif) **NOTE**<br>
   > If the command fails to be executed and the system displays a message indicating that the openssh-server and openssh-client depend on different versions, install the openssh-client of the required version (for example, **sudo apt-get install openssh-client=1:8.2p1-4**) as prompted on the command-line interface (CLI) and run the command again to install the openssh-server.

   
   ```
   sudo apt-get install openssh-server
   ```

2. Run the following command to start the SSH service:
   
   ```
   sudo systemctl start ssh
   ```

3. Run the following command to obtain the IP address of the current user for remote access to the Ubuntu environment from Windows:
   
   ```
   ifconfig
   ```

   ![en-us_image_0000001215737140](figures/en-us_image_0000001215737140.png)
