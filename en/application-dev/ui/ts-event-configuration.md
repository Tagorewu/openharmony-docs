# Event Configuration


You can use event methods to configure events supported by components.


- Example of using a lambda expression to configure the event of a component:
    
  ```ts
  // Counter is a private data variable defined in the component.
  Button('add counter')
      .onClick(() => {
          this.counter += 2
      })
  ```


- When using an anonymous function expression to configure the event of a component, bind must be used to ensure that the contained components are referenced by this in the function body.
    
  ```ts
  // Counter is a private data variable defined in the component.
  Button('add counter')
      .onClick(function () {
          this.counter += 2
      }.bind(this))
  ```


- Example of using a component's member function to configure the event of the component:
    
  ```ts
  myClickHandler(): void {
      // do something
  }
  
  ...
  
  Button('add counter')
    .onClick(this.myClickHandler)
  ```
