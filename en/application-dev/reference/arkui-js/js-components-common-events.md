# Universal Events

>  **NOTE**<br>
>  Universal events are supported since API version 4. Updates will be marked with a superscript to indicate their earliest API version.

## Event Description

- Events are bound to components. When a component meets the event triggering condition, the corresponding event callback in the JS is executed to implement the interaction between the UI and the JS logic layer of the page.

- The event callback can carry additional information through parameters, such as the dataset on the component and event-specific callback parameters.


Different from private events, universal events can be bound to most components.

>  **NOTE**<br>
>  Events not listed in the preceding table do not support bubbling, such as the [change event](../arkui-js/js-components-basic-input.md#events) of the **<input\>** component. For details, see the description of the specific component.

**Table 1** BaseEvent

| Attribute                   | Type                  | Description                          |
| --------------------- | -------------------- | --------------------------- |
| type                  | string               | Event type, such as **click** and **longpress**.|
| timestamp             | number               | Timestamp when the event is triggered.                |
| deviceId<sup>6+</sup> | number               | ID of the device that triggers the event.              |
| target<sup>6+</sup>   | [Target](#target6)| Target object that triggers the event.                |

| touches        | Array&lt;TouchInfo&gt; | Attribute set of the touch event, including the information array of the touch points on the screen.                |
| changedTouches | Array&lt;TouchInfo&gt; | Attribute set when a touch event occurs, including the information array of changed touch points on the screen. **changedTouches** has the same data format as **touches** and indicates touch point changes, including changes in the number and location of touch points. For example, when the user's finger leaves the screen, which means that the number of touch points changes from 1 to 0, **changedTouches** has the relevant data generated, but not **touches**.|

| globalX                   | number                           | Horizontal distance from the upper left corner of the screen, which acts as the origin of coordinates.|
| globalY                   | number                           | Vertical distance from the upper left corner of the screen, which acts as the origin of coordinates.|

## Target<sup>6+</sup>

When a component triggers an event, the event callback receives an event object by default. You can obtain the corresponding information through the event object.

| Attribute                  | Type    | Description                                      |
| -------------------- | ------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| dataSet<sup>6+</sup> | Object | Custom attribute set defined through [data-*](../arkui-js/js-components-common-attributes.md).|

**Example**

```html
<!-- xxx.hml -->
<div>
  <div data-a="dataA" data-b="dataB" 
    style="width: 100%; height: 50%; background-color: saddlebrown;"@touchstart='touchstartfunc'></div>
</div>
```

```js
// xxx.js
export default {
  touchstartfunc(msg) {
    console.info(`on touch start, point is: ${msg.touches[0].globalX}`);
    console.info(`on touch start, data is: ${msg.target.dataSet.a}`);
  }
}
```
