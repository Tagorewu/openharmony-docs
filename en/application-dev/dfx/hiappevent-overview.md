# Overview of Application Event Logging

HiAppEvent provides event logging APIs for applications to log the fault, statistical, security, and user behavior events reported during running. Based on event information, you will be able to analyze the running status of your application.

The HiAppEvent module can be used to develop application event-related functions, including flushing application events to a disk and querying historical application events.
